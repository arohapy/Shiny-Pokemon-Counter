Shiny-Pokemon-Counter

A quick little program I made so I can store my shiny reset counter in the cloud for easy access across multiple devices. Still new to python so bear with my messy code!

1.4:

Can now use multiple save files and select the amount of systems the user is resetting with.

1.3:

Added a section to confirm if you want to overwrite or load data.

1.2:

Added a version compatible with windows.

Version 1.1:

Fixed a bug I completely overlooked in the first version.
